                <p>
                    Hello, My name is <strong>Tabo Khumalo</strong> and welcome to my Web development and
                    Software engineering porfolio.<br><br>
                    Here I will show case all the Projects that I have Started and finished and
                    will give you an insight on how good or bad
                    I am at this.<br><br>
                    Here is a short story about my Coding Journey. I started hearing about
                    coding a year or two ago and learned that it is an important skill and more
                    importantly for me was the fact that you can teach it to yourself.
                    I started looking in to ways to start learning, and for a year I started
                    and stopped without any real progress.<br><br>
                    Joined a couple of cohort programs and never finished them. I guess I had no purpose,
                    I was just attracted by the earning potential Coding had to offer.
                    I lost interest but after seeing what you can actually do and achieve
                    with code, the possibilities and the change it can bring, it sparked a love
                    for code and I am now a Begginer again but a with purpose.<br><br>
                    I am happy to have you look at my..what I like to call Code art. <strong>Enjoy!</strong>
