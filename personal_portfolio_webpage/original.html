          <p id="story"> Hello, My name is Tabo Khumalo and welcome to my Web development and Software engineering porfolio. Here I will show case all the Projects that I have Started and finished and will give you an insight on how good or bad I am at this.Short story about my Coding Journey, I started hearing more about coding a year or two ago and learned that it is an important skill and more importantly for me was the fact that you can teach it to yourself. I started looking in to ways to start learning, and for a year I started and stopped without any real progress. Joined a couple of cohort programs and never finished them. I guess I had no purpose, I was just attracted by the earning potential Coding had to offer. I lost interest but after seeing what you can actually do and archive with code and the possibilities and change it can bring it sparked a love for code and I am now a Begginer with purpose and happy to have you look at my..what I like to call Code art. Enjoy!
